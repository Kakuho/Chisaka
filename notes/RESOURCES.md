# Resources

The following lists resources I found helpful in building this OS:

* OSDEV wiki: https://wiki.osdev.org/Main_Page
	
	Contains a goldmine of information, and useful pointers to research for where you want to 
	take your operating system further.

* Intel x86 Processor Documentation: https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/articles/technical/intel-sdm.html

	Detailed explanation for all you want to know of intel x86 processors. Get it from the 
	source.
    
* GCC's C++ Standard Library Implementation: https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc-4.6.2/libstdc++/api/index.html

	Great reference for building standard library implementations.

* Textbooks:

    In general I prefer textbooks which contains theory and also implementation, where the 
    implementation is used to frame the theory. I have found two textbooks I have got along 
    with, those being:

    * Operating Systems Design and Implementation: Design and Implementation. Third Edition (Prentice Hall Software Series).

    * Operating System Design: The Xinu approach.

    OSDI tends to be more encyclopedic and provides surveys of existing algorithms, meanwhile xinu is a fairly simple system to learn and hack on. 
    OSDI contains references to other algorithms which will prove useful when experimenting.
