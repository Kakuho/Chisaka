Grains is my run time testing framework for OS projects

This directory holds procedures which performs individual run time test of the system.

For now, each runtime test is an instance of the kernel image.

This helps me remember what code I've written and why, since its hard to run unit testing on 
operating systems

Invoking more than one runtime test is considered an error.
